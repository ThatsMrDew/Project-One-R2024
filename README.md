# Project-One-R2024
	This analysis examines a data set generated by a user over the course of four months utilizing inputs from the Samsung Galaxy Health Application. Our group sought answers to four questions derived from the data set:
1.	Does an Active Day Increase or Decrease Sleep?
2.	Does an Active Day Improve Mood?
3.	Does Consistency in Activity Result in more calories burned?
4.	Does Consistency in Activity Result in Longer Stretches of Positive Moods?
Through the use of data frames and visualizations we answered each of these questions. Below you will find the questions asked, and the tools used to seek answers.
Created copies of the Dataframe to ensure no cross contamination takes place

1) Does an Active Day Increase or Decrease Sleep? 
    •	A bar plot comparing average total sleep hours between active and inactive individuals. 
    •	A plot displaying daily step counts with a trendline. Statistical analysis reveals whether increased physical activity (step counts) is linked to improved sleep quality (total sleep hours). A strong positive correlation would suggest that more active days lead to better sleep, reinforcing the idea that physical activity may enhance sleep quality. 
2) Does an Active Day improve Mood?
**Conversion of Boolean to String**
    •	The Pie Chart represents a holistic view of Mood inputs over the course of 4 months. Distribution is relatively evenly spread amongst Neutral (28.1%) and Negative (30.2%) while a more significant portion of time was spent holding a Positive Mood State (41.7%). This visualization provides a solid view that we will utilize when drilling down the dataset
    •	The Histogram represents the spread of Mood Placement by Daily Activity with the views being inverted to show a significant output of the Positive Mood Value (300), equal levels of the Neutral Mood (200) output, and a significant drop in the Negative Mood output (100) when the user reports an Active Day, resulting in a stance that an Active day somewhat improves mood.
3) Does Consistency in Activity Result in more calories burned?
**Conversion of Boolean to String**
    •	Pie Chart representing the percentage of days the subject was active and inactive
    •	Box plot shows the distribution of calories the subject burned on active and inactive days. The outliers and medians are represented here
    •	Histogram represents how many times the subject burned/didn't burn the same amount of calories
4) Does Consistency in Activity Result in Longer Stretches of Positive Moods?
	Data Preparation:
         o	Thresholds:
            	Activity defined as a step count greater than 3000.
            	Positive mood defined as a mood score greater than 200.
         o	Boolean columns created for "Is Active" and "Positive Mood".
	Streak Analysis:
         o	Streak IDs were generated based on activity changes to measure the lengths of active streaks.
    Results:
         o	Mean Streak Length: 3 days
         o	Count of Streaks: 32 instances of activity
         o	Positive mood during active streaks showed a mean value of 1.
    Visualizations:
         o	Bar Plot: Displays the relationship between active streak length and positive mood.
         o	Histogram: Illustrates the distribution of streak lengths.
         o	Line Chart: Compares streak lengths against positive mood trends.
         o	Correlation Heatmap: Shows correlations between variables.
    Statistical Analysis:
         o	Moderate correlation between positive mood and streak length (0.4247).
         o	No significant association between activity and positive mood (Chi-square p-value: 0.55).
         o	T-test results indicate no significant difference (p-value: 1.0).
